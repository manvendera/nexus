# My First Website Project

Welcome to my website! I built this while learning how to code.

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a simple website for a digital agency called "Nexus". It has a home page, about page, services, blog, and contact form.

## 🛠️ How I built it

I used:

- **HTML**: To make the structure of the pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I used the CDN link so I didn't have to install anything. It makes styling really easy!
- **Google Fonts**: For nice text (Inter font).
- **Simple JavaScript**: Just a tiny bit of code to make the mobile menu work.

## 📂 Project Files

Here are the pages I made:

1. **index.html**: The main home page.
2. **about.html**: Information about the team (with some cool placeholder images!).
3. **services.html**: What the company does.
4. **blog.html**: A place for news.
5. **contact.html**: A form to get in touch.

## 💻 How to view it

You don't need to install anything!

1. Download the folder.
2. Double-click on `index.html`.
3. That's it! It runs right in your browser.

## ✨ Features

- It works on mobile phones (responsive!).
- It has a working navigation menu.
- It uses consistent colors (Blue and Orange).
